### Notes
A weird XCode issue where it said something about an editor placeholder in my source file caused me to (probably unnecessarily) scrap the entire project and begin anew to identify where exactly the issue was coming from because I could not track it down in my original file. When I was trying to make the layout for the superhero posters, it took me a while to get the layout to display correctly. It wouldn't resolve itself until I added constraints to the PosterView. I apologize for the late submission but I tested positive for COVID on the 14th and have been recovering from it all week.
